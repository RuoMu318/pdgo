# PDGO Complete Work

Run evidence-before-completion checks, record residual risk, and prepare a branch handoff without silently merging or pushing.

## Routing and department contract

Run the declared tests and inspect their actual output before saying complete. Record the final diff, acceptance checklist, residual risks, rollback, and integration decision. Merging, pushing, or cleanup remains a separately authorized action.

## PDGO operating contract

This Skill is the active PDGO route for the declared scenario. Apply the workflow below only after startup routing has classified the project, operation, department, stage, inputs, outputs, constraints, risk, mode, and approval state. A Skill name or keyword is never sufficient evidence for selection.

The Planning Department owns the contract with the user: objective, observable outcome, modification scope, excluded scope, assumptions, dependencies, acceptance criteria, expected evidence, risks, blockers, rollback, stop conditions, and the explicit rule not to deepen implementation detail without a request. Long work is split into named serial and parallel stages. Each stage declares its required Skills, candidate specialist Agents, dependencies, isolation policy, and acceptance gate.

The Planning Department also controls the loop: dispatch one stage or an isolated parallel set, collect worker reports, obtain an independent review, accept only evidence that matches the exact plan version, and issue an in-scope correction when a review returns `revision-required`. A failed or blocked item is not silently skipped. Dependents unlock only after acceptance and all blockers are `resolved` with evidence.

The Execution Department receives one immutable `PLAN_DISPATCH` at a time. It may edit only allowed paths, must observe forbidden actions and stop conditions, must run the declared verification, and must return changed paths, tests, evidence, assumptions, deviations, risks, and blockers. Workers cannot self-approve or expand the plan.

An abnormal execution stop is never normal completion. The Execution Department must immediately send a formal `BLOCKER_REPORT` to the fixed Planning Department conversation with the blocker reason, impact, recommended solution, and `requires_user` disposition. Planning must record and answer it with `PLANNING_BLOCKER_OPINION`: when planning can resolve every blocker inside the approved contract it records the resolutions and re-dispatches the stopped task; when it cannot, it sends `USER_ACTION_REQUIRED` in the planning conversation and keeps execution paused. Normal completion does not trigger this escalation path.

Every session records the instruction, checkpoints, dispatches, reports, decisions, summaries, unresolved items, and cross-session references. Search indexes first and read summaries before source turns. Link artifacts to project, plan, version, task, dispatch, session, tests, and commit where applicable.

Specialist Agents are advisory task workers selected from the locked catalog and its evidence metadata. Search by the concrete scenario and division, inspect the source prompt SHA, and include the exact `external_agent_id` in the approved dispatch. A low-confidence or `manual-only` entry cannot be auto-routed. A specialist Agent cannot approve a plan, close a blocker, change scope, or replace an independent review.

Continuous dispatch is permitted only when the exact user approval matches `plan_id` and `plan_version`, every acknowledged risk and blocker disposition is present, dependencies are accepted, the active stage is ready, the selected Agent metadata is eligible, the transport returned real session IDs, and the scope has not changed. File queues are explicit, auditable handoff adapters; they do not prove a live Agent session. Missing transport, invalid SHA, missing evidence, a new material risk, a new blocker, or a scope change pauses the series and returns it to planning. Planning escalates to the user only when it cannot resolve the blocker inside the approved contract or a material change requires new approval.

Do not claim completion from intent, queued files, mock responses, or a self-reported status. Completion requires independent review, verification evidence, no unresolved blockers, and the exact approved acceptance criteria. Rollback follows the approved plan and is recorded as an auditable event.

## Evidence and stop conditions

Return actual commands and outputs, changed paths, and unresolved uncertainty. Stop immediately when the approved scope, plan version, transport capability, Agent source SHA, or acceptance contract no longer matches.

## Integrated workflow

# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
❌ "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**
```
✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
❌ "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**
```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
❌ Trust agent report
```

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:**
- ANY variation of success/completion claims
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- ANY positive statement about work state
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task
- Delegating to agents

**Rule applies to:**
- Exact phrases
- Paraphrases and synonyms
- Implications of success
- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness

# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Detect environment → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## Step 1: Verify Tests

Run the project's full test suite (`npm test` / `cargo test` / `pytest` / `go test ./...`).

**If tests fail**, report the failures and stop — the menu comes after a green suite:

```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]
```

**If tests pass:** continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Detect Environment

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
# Capture now, while still inside the workspace — Step 5 changes directory
# before cleanup (Step 6) needs this value
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State | Menu | Cleanup |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo) | Standard 3 options | No worktree to clean up |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch | Standard 3 options | Provenance-based (see Step 6) |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 2 options (no merge) | Externally managed — leave in place |

## Step 3: Determine Base Branch

The base branch is whatever this work forked from — usually named in the
plan, the conversation, or the branch's upstream. If it is not already
known, ask: "This branch split from <your best guess> - is that correct?"
Confirm before merging: merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo.

## Step 4: Present Options

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — present exactly these 3 options:**

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 2 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace).

1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

Present the menu exactly as written — concise, with every option coming
from the list above. Discarding the work happens only in response to your
human partner explicitly asking for it (see "If your human partner asks to
discard the work" below). Wait for their answer; the integration decision
is theirs.

## Step 5: Execute Choice

### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Get main repo root for CWD safety
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"

# Merge first — verify success before removing anything
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>
```

If tests fail on the merged result: stop, leave the worktree and branch in
place, and investigate — nothing has been pushed, so the merge is local
and recoverable.

Once the merged result is green: clean up the worktree (Step 6), then
delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
# From a detached HEAD, name the new branch on the remote:
# git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/<new-branch>
```

Then create the pull/merge request against <base-branch> with the forge's
tooling — its CLI if one is available, or the creation URL most forges
print when you push — following the repo's PR template and conventions if
present, and report the URL to your human partner.

Keep the worktree — your human partner iterates on PR feedback there.

### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

### If your human partner asks to discard the work

This path exists only as a response to an explicit request to throw the
work away. Confirm first:

```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for that exact confirmation. When it arrives:

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
```

Then clean up the worktree (Step 6) and force-delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

## Step 6: Cleanup Workspace

**Runs for Option 1 and confirmed discards.** Options 2 and 3 always
preserve the worktree. Both callers have already changed directory to the
main repo root — worktree removal must run from outside the worktree —
and use the `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_COMMON`/`WORKTREE_PATH` values captured in
Step 2, from before that directory change.

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** Normal repo, no worktree to clean up. Done.

**If `WORKTREE_PATH` is under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`:** PDGO
created this worktree — we own cleanup:

```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune  # Self-healing: clean up any stale registrations
```

**Otherwise:** The host environment owns this workspace — leave it in
place. If your platform provides a workspace-exit tool, use it.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | yes | - | - | yes |
| 2. Create PR | - | yes | yes | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | yes | - |
| Discard (explicit request only) | - | - | - | yes (force) |

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Tests passed earlier this session" | Run the suite on the tree you are about to integrate. A green run only proves the tree it ran on. |
| "They obviously want it merged" | Integration is your human partner's decision. Present the menu and wait. |
| "They seem done with this feature — I'll offer to discard it" | The menu is complete as written. Discard happens only when your human partner asks for it in so many words. |
| "'Yeah, get rid of it' counts as confirmation" | Only the typed word `discard` authorizes deletion. |
| "The PR is up, so the worktree is clutter now" | PR feedback gets fixed in that worktree. It stays until the work lands. |
| "This other worktree looks stale — I'll clean it too" | Clean up only worktrees under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`. Everything else belongs to the host. |
| "The merged-result failure is probably flaky" | A failing merged result stops everything. Branch and worktree stay put while you investigate. |
| "The base branch is obviously main" | Confirm the fork point or ask. Merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo. |
| "The push was rejected — force-push will fix it" | A rejected push means the remote moved. Investigate; force-push only on your human partner's explicit request. |

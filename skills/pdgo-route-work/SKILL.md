# PDGO Route Work

Select the active PDGO Skill and eligible Agency Agent from the classified scenario before any governed response or dispatch.

## Routing and department contract

Route first, then invoke the selected Skill. Record rejected candidates and stop with `skill-unresolved` when hard filters cannot be satisfied. A request for clarification is itself routed and governed.

## PDGO operating contract

This Skill is the active PDGO route for the declared scenario. Apply the workflow below only after startup routing has classified the project, operation, department, stage, inputs, outputs, constraints, risk, mode, and approval state. A Skill name or keyword is never sufficient evidence for selection.

The Planning Department owns the contract with the user: objective, observable outcome, modification scope, excluded scope, assumptions, dependencies, acceptance criteria, expected evidence, risks, blockers, rollback, stop conditions, and the explicit rule not to deepen implementation detail without a request. Long work is split into named serial and parallel stages. Each stage declares its required Skills, candidate Agency Agents, dependencies, isolation policy, and acceptance gate.

The Planning Department also controls the loop: dispatch one stage or an isolated parallel set, collect worker reports, obtain an independent review, accept only evidence that matches the exact plan version, and issue an in-scope correction when a review returns `revision-required`. A failed or blocked item is not silently skipped. Dependents unlock only after acceptance and all blockers are `resolved` with evidence.

The Execution Department receives one immutable `PLAN_DISPATCH` at a time. It may edit only allowed paths, must observe forbidden actions and stop conditions, must run the declared verification, and must return changed paths, tests, evidence, assumptions, deviations, risks, and blockers. Workers cannot self-approve or expand the plan.

Every session records the instruction, checkpoints, dispatches, reports, decisions, summaries, unresolved items, and cross-session references. Search indexes first and read summaries before source turns. Link artifacts to project, plan, version, task, dispatch, session, tests, and commit where applicable.

Agency Agents are advisory task workers selected from the locked catalog and its evidence metadata. Search by the concrete scenario and division, inspect the source prompt SHA, and include the exact `external_agent_id` in the approved dispatch. A low-confidence or `manual-only` entry cannot be auto-routed. An Agency Agent cannot approve a plan, close a blocker, change scope, or replace an independent review.

Continuous dispatch is permitted only when the exact user approval matches `plan_id` and `plan_version`, every acknowledged risk and blocker disposition is present, dependencies are accepted, the active stage is ready, the selected Agent metadata is eligible, the transport returned real session IDs, and the scope has not changed. File queues are explicit, auditable handoff adapters; they do not prove a live Agent session. Missing transport, invalid SHA, missing evidence, a new material risk, a new blocker, or a scope change pauses the series and returns it to planning and the user.

Do not claim completion from intent, queued files, mock responses, or a self-reported status. Completion requires independent review, verification evidence, no unresolved blockers, and the exact approved acceptance criteria. Rollback follows the approved plan and is recorded as an auditable event.

## Evidence and stop conditions

Return actual commands and outputs, changed paths, and unresolved uncertainty. Stop immediately when the approved scope, plan version, transport capability, Agent source SHA, or acceptance contract no longer matches.

## Integrated workflow

<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, ignore this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action** — including clarifying questions, exploring the codebase, or checking files. If it turns out wrong for the situation, you don't have to use it.

**Before entering plan mode:** if you haven't already brainstormed, invoke the brainstorming skill first.

Then announce "Using [skill] to [purpose]" and follow the skill exactly. If it has a checklist, create a todo per item.

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills apply, process skills come first — they set the approach, then implementation skills (frontend-design, etc.) carry it out. Brainstorming and systematic-debugging are Superpowers' most common process skills, but the rule holds for any of them.

- "Let's build X" → superpowers:brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
- "Fix this bug" → superpowers:systematic-debugging first, then domain skills.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Platform Adaptation

If your harness appears here, read its reference file for special instructions:

- Codex: `references/codex-tools.md`
- Pi: `references/pi-tools.md`
- Antigravity: `references/antigravity-tools.md`

## User Instructions

User instructions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, etc, direct requests) take precedence over skills, which in turn override default behavior. Only skip skill workflows or instructions when your human partner has explicitly told you to.
